# Workforce-Efficiency-Analysis

Project Summary
Business Case & Goal:
The goal of this project is to predict the performance rating of employees based on various features in the dataset. This analysis will help in identifying key factors affecting performance, department-wise performance, and building a model for hiring decisions. Additionally, recommendations for improving employee performance will be provided based on insights from the analysis.

Dataset Overview:
Size: 1200 rows, 28 columns
Features:
Quantitative: 19 (11 numeric, 8 ordinal)
Qualitative: 8
Irrelevant Feature: EmpNumber (alphanumeric)
Project Goals:
Department-wise performance analysis
Identifying the top 3 important factors affecting employee performance
Building a model to predict employee performance
Providing recommendations to improve employee performance

Analysis Types:
Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis:
Univariate Analysis: Examines the distribution of individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Studies the relationship between features and the target variable.
Multivariate Analysis: Analyzes the relationship between multiple features concerning the target variable.
Key Insights:
Positive correlation with performance rating: EmpEnvironmentSatisfaction, EmpLastSalaryHikePercent, EmpWorkLifeBalance.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Distribution and Statistical Measures:
Analyzed distributions for features like age, number of companies worked, hourly rate, and work experience.
Checked skewness and kurtosis of features.
Found skewness in features like YearsSinceLastPromotion.
Data Pre-Processing:
Missing Values: None
Categorical Data Conversion:
Manual Encoding: Mapping labels based on frequency.
Frequency Encoding: Transforming categorical data into numerical values based on frequency distribution.
Outlier Handling: Using IQR for non-normally distributed features.
Feature Transformation: Applied square root transformation to handle skewness.
Scaling Data: Standard scaling (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1).
Feature Selection:
Dropped unique and constant features.
Checked correlations using a heatmap.
Found no highly correlated features.
Applied PCA, reducing dimensions to 25 features.
Machine Learning Model Creation & Evaluation

Goal 1: Department-Wise Performance Analysis
Insights:
Sales: Level 3 performers dominate; males slightly outperform females.
Human Resources: Level 3 is the majority; older employees perform lower, females perform well.
Development: Predominantly level 3 performers; gender performance is similar.
Data Science: Highest level 3 performance; fewer level 2 performers, males do better.
Research & Development: Age doesnâ€™t affect performance levels; females perform well.
Finance: Performance decreases with age; males perform better; experience inversely related to performance.
Goal 2: Top 3 Important Factors Affecting Employee Performance
Employment Environment Satisfaction: Most employees at levels 3 and 4.
Employee Salary Hike Percentage: High performance linked to salary hikes between 11-19% and 20-22%.
Employee Work Life Balance: Level 3 shows the highest performance rating.
Goal 3: A Trained Model to Predict Employee Performance
Model Accuracy:
Support Vector Classifier: 98.28%
Random Forest Classifier: 95.61%
Artificial Neural Network (MLP): 95.80%
Goal 4: Recommendations to Improve Employee Performance
Focus on improving employee environment satisfaction.
Implement regular salary hikes to boost performance.
Promote employees every 6 months.
Enhance work-life balance.
Prefer female candidates for HR roles.
Leverage the higher performance in development and sales departments.
Pay attention to employees with low/medium job satisfaction and relationship satisfaction as they often show excellent performance.
